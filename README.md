# The Program:
This project addresses the Stock Purchase Maximization Problem, aiming to maximize the number of stocks an investor can purchase within a given budget. The problem involves a set of stocks, each with a specified number and value. Exhaustive search and dynamic programming are implemented to determine the optimal stock selection while following the budget constraints.
 

# Instructions on how to run the program: 
1. Run the file "approach A.py" by typing the command "python approachA.py" in terminal.
2. The program will run and generate a file called "approachA_ouput.txt" that will contain all the results. 
3. Run the file "approach B.py" by typing the command "python approachB.py" in terminal.
4. The program will run and generate a file called "approachB_ouput.txt" that will contain all the results.
